# Summary

Many existing GIS and machine learning tools lack advanced algorithms and are often difficult to access or integrate. These limitations hinder researchers from conducting efficient and scalable geospatial analysis. To address these challenges, this paper proposes geoanalytics, an open-source Python library developed explicitly for geospatial data analysis. The library offers more than 50 algorithms that cover a wide range of tasks, including clustering, classification, imputation, pattern mining, and data visualization. It is platform-independent and can be easily installed via PyPI. The library is compatible with popular environments like Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook. It supports both raster and tabular data formats, including GeoTIFF and CSV. Additionally, the results generated by geoAnalytics can be exported in widely used formats such as CSV and raster, ensuring smooth integration with other GIS software.


# Background in Geo-Spatial Analysis

Many widely used GIS platforms, such as ArcGIS [@ArcGIS], QGIS [@QGIS], and ENVI [@ENVI], provide tools for raster data analysis. Although feature-rich, these platforms often rely on traditional algorithms that limit analytical depth and accuracy. A notable example is the continued use of k-Means clustering in ENVI [@li2020comparison] and ArcGIS [@bennett2018machine]. These methods were developed in the 1970s and do not solve key problems like proper cluster initialization, which affects the quality of the results.

These limitations have prompted researchers to develop improved clustering strategies. For example, Pasi and Sami [@franti2019much] proposed enhanced initialization methods that significantly improve clustering performance. However, these advancements have yet to be integrated into most GIS software. Additionally, some tools like Raster Miner [@veena2024rasterminer] offer raster processing capabilities but still lack advanced analytical methods. Consequently, users often depend on less effective tools that are inadequate for analyzing complex geospatial data.

Therefore, to fully leverage the potential of geospatial data and overcome these challenges, GIS software must integrate modern machine learning and deep learning techniques. Such methods can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of geospatial analysis, making GIS platforms more capable of addressing today’s complex and data-intensive demands.

# Statement of need

Most existing machine learning libraries, including Scikit-learn [@kramer2016scikit] and TensorFlow [@developers2022tensorflow], are not explicitly designed to handle the unique spatial and temporal patterns inherent in geospatial data. Similarly, traditional GIS software such as ArcGIS, QGIS, and ENVI relies heavily on older algorithms that limit the accuracy and depth of geospatial analysis. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of open-source tools that integrate recent advances in clustering, classification, imputation, and pattern mining tailored for geospatial applications. This gap hinders reproducibility and restricts broader adoption within the research community.

To bridge these limitations, the geoanalytics library [@GeoAnalytics] was developed as an open-source Python package tailored for geospatial data analysis. It is an open-source Python package with over 50 algorithms explicitly designed for geospatial analysis. The library supports both raster and tabular data formats. It works well with platforms like Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab and can be used through scripts or Python modules.

By providing access to modern and specialized geospatial algorithms, geoAnalytics empowers researchers, data scientists, and practitioners to analyze complex geospatial datasets with greater accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility. This makes it a valuable tool for advancing geospatial research and applications.

# Areas of Research

### Geospatial & Spatiotemporal Data Analysis and Visualization

This area focuses on analyzing spatial data from sources like satellite imagery, remote sensing, and georeferenced measurements. The library supports raster and tabular formats such as GeoTIFF, NetCDF, and CSV. It includes tools for preprocessing, such as handling missing values, extracting spatial coordinates, and converting raster to tabular form. Users can apply clustering, classification, and pattern mining methods for geospatial contexts. Clustering algorithms like k-Means++, DBSCAN, BIRCH, Spectral Clustering, and Mean Shift are used to group data based on spatial, spectral, or temporal similarities. These are useful for land cover classification, urban development tracking, and anomaly detection. 

Spatiotemporal mining techniques discover patterns that recur over time and space. These are applied in climate monitoring and planetary surface studies. Advanced methods also support the identification of periodic and partially periodic spatial patterns. Visualization features such as plotting clusters, nearest points, and spatial boundaries support exploratory analysis and interpretation. The library also integrates with PostgreSQL/PostGIS, allowing users to insert, update, or convert raster data directly from databases.

### Data Imputation and Applications in Remote Sensing
Incomplete data is common in remote sensing due to sensor errors or obstructions. This area addresses such issues using various imputation techniques. Basic methods include forward/backwards fill and statistical approaches like mean, median, and mode. Advanced methods include KNN, MICE, and Hot Deck imputation.

Imputed data is then ready for classification, clustering, and pattern identification, ensuring higher reliability in remote sensing applications.

### Planetary and Astrophysical Data Analysis
The library also supports analysis of planetary and astrophysical imagery. It has been applied to lunar satellite data for clustering and imputation. These tools can be extended to other datasets, such as Mars rover images or asteroid observations, making them valuable in space research and planetary science.

# Sample Test Case
![Analysis of Lunar data using geoAnalytics software](<Figures/test_case.png>){ width=95% }

Figure 3 illustrates a complete preprocessing-to-visualization pipeline using the geoanalytics library applied to lunar satellite data.

* *(a) Lunar Data (.tiff file)*: The pipeline begins with a multispectral lunar surface image in TIFF format, comprising multiple bands of spectral data.

* *Raster2TSV Converter*: This module converts the raster image data into a structured tabular format. Each pixel in the raster is transformed into a row, capturing its spatial coordinates (x, y) and the spectral intensity values across all bands. The output is stored in a .csv file.

* *(b) .csv file*: The converted file contains metadata and band-wise reflectance values for each pixel, serving as the input for downstream geoanalytic algorithms.

* *Algorithm Module*: Any algorithm from the geoanalytics library can be applied to the spectral data to identify underlying patterns or material types. In the sample case, we have utilized the Fuzzy C-Means Clustering algorithm from the clustering domain. The output is a .csv file containing spatial coordinates and the computed cluster labels.

* *(c) Clustered Labels*: This file includes the pixel centres and corresponding cluster labels, indicating the predicted class or material group for each point on the lunar surface.

* *CSV2Raster Converter*: This module converts the labeled data back into raster format for inspection in a TIFF viewer to facilitate spatial visualisation.

* *(d) TIFF Viewers*: The final clustered outputs are visualized in two styles: jet scale for intuitive color-coded segmentation and grayscale for intensity-based representation. These help interpret the clustering results in the context of spatial features and variations across the lunar surface.

This test case highlights the end-to-end capability of geoAnalytics in transforming geospatial raster data into interpretable analytical outputs suitable for Earth and planetary science research.

The execution code for this test case is made publicly available on the geoAnalytics repository in Github [@GeoAnalytics]
