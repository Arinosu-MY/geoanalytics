# Introduction

PAttern MIning (PAMI) is a Python library containing several algorithms to discover user interest-based patterns in a wide-spectrum of datasets across multiple computing platforms. Useful links to utilize the services of this library were provided below:

# Maintenance

  __Installation__


         pip install geoAnalytics


  __Upgradation__

  
        pip install --upgrade geoAnalytics
  

  __Uninstallation__

  
        pip uninstall geoAnalytics 
       

  __Information__ 


        pip show geoAnalytics

***
# *Try your first geoAnalytics program*

```shell
$ python
```

```python
# first import pami 
from PAMI.frequentPattern.basic import FPGrowth as alg
fileURL = "https://u-aizu.ac.jp/~udayrage/datasets/transactionalDatabases/Transactional_T10I4D100K.csv"
minSup=300
obj = alg.FPGrowth(iFile=fileURL, minSup=minSup, sep='\t')
#obj.mine()  #deprecated
obj.mine()
obj.save('frequentPatternsAtMinSupCount300.txt')
frequentPatternsDF= obj.getPatternsAsDataFrame()
print('Total No of patterns: ' + str(len(frequentPatternsDF))) #print the total number of patterns
print('Runtime: ' + str(obj.getRuntime())) #measure the runtime
print('Memory (RSS): ' + str(obj.getMemoryRSS()))
print('Memory (USS): ' + str(obj.getMemoryUSS()))
```

```
Output:
Frequent patterns were generated successfully using frequentPatternGrowth algorithm
Total No of patterns: 4540
Runtime: 8.749667644500732
Memory (RSS): 522911744
Memory (USS): 475353088

# Evaluation:

1. we compared three different Python libraries such as PAMI, mlxtend and efficient-apriori for Apriori.
2. (Transactional_T10I4D100K.csv)is a transactional database downloaded from PAMI and
used as an input file for all libraries.
3. Minimum support values and seperator are also same.

* The performance of the **Apriori algorithm** is shown in the graphical results below:
1. Comparing the **Patterns Generated** by different Python libraries for the Apriori algorithm:

2. Evaluating the **Runtime** of the Apriori algorithm across different Python libraries:

3. Comparing the **Memory Consumption** of the Apriori algorithm across different Python libraries:

# Background

The idea and motivation to develop PAMI was from [Kitsuregawa Lab](https://www.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/new/resources?lang=en) at the University of Tokyo. Work on ``PAMI`` started at [University of Aizu](https://u-aizu.ac.jp/en/) in 2020 and
has been under active development since then.
